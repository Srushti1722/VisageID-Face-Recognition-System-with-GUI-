# VisageID-Face-Recognition-System-with-GUI-

VisageID is a video-based, dynamic face recognition system with an intuitive graphical interface, designed for seamless identity verification and facial database management. 

A complete face recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, and SQLite with a modern GUI built in Tkinter/CustomTkinter. 


# Main steps
Make sure to :

1)first capture the image 

2)train the model

3)Than try Recognize the face.

**For more accuracy capture more images **


# 🎥Register their face with ID and Name 

🧬 Train a model using LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) 

🔍Recognize faces in real time via webcam 

🗂 Manage user data through a local SQLite database 

📁 Organize known and unknown images with auto-sorting 

🖥️ Interact through a clean, user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter and CustomTkinter 

📦 Maintain modularity with a well-structured trainer and dataset pipeline


# 🚀 Features
